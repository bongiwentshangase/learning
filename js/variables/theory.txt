Think of a variable as a box in the computer's memory.

The box can hold different types of values.

number e.g 6 or 7.23
string e.g "hello
boolean e.g true or false
null  this means there is nothing in the box
undefined this means no value has been given to the box

Old 

var x = 5;


New / ES6

let x = 5;
x="hello";  this is allowed.
const y =7; it means the variable will stay the same 
y=8;  uou cant do this. not allowedt to change
